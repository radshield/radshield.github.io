ShieldsUp is a set of two software systems that protect against the two most prevalent single-event effects facing spacecraft operators today: single-event latchups and single-event upsets.

##### Hold up, radiation errors?

Yes! On Earth, we're protected by the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere, which deflects or absorbs most of the ionizing radiation from the sun.
However, spacecraft in orbit or deep space don't have the same protections, and are exposed to heavy amounts of ionizing radiation.
Ionizing radiation causes all sorts of nasty errors on the satellites.
